    \title Qt Sensors - Cube House QML Accelerometer example
    \ingroup qtsensors-examples
    \brief The Cube House example demonstrates the use of the accelerometer to drive a camera to create a pseudo-3D effect.

\section1 Overview
    To write a QML application that will use the QML Accelerometer type from the QtMobility.sensors import you need to to the following steps:

    Import the QtMobility.sensors declarative plugin:

\snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/cubehouse.qml 0

    Add the Accelerometer QML types into your qml file.

\snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/cubehouse.qml 1

    In additional two properties are added to save the calculated pitch and roll values:

\snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/cubehouse.qml 2

    Reading out the Accelerometer data can be done by implementing the 'onReadingChanged' slot and
    accessing the 'reading' property from the Accelerometer type:

\snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/cubehouse.qml 3

    By using a timer the view can be rotated using the pitch and roll properties from the Accelerometer type:

\snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/cubehouse.qml 4
