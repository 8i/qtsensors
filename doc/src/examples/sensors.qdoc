    The Cube House example demonstrates the use of the accelerometer to drive a camera
    to create a pseudo-3D effect. It also demonstrates the use of a filter to smooth
    out the accelerometer values.

    The accelerometer is created and the filter is added.

    \snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/view.cpp accelerometer

    When new values are available, the view is recalculated.

    \snippet ../examples/sensors/cubehouse/view.cpp accelerometer2

    The filter is defined like this.
