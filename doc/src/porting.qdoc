    \title Porting Applications from QtMobility Sensors to Qt Sensors

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Overview

    The initial release of Qt Sensors (5.0) is generally expected to be source
    compatible with QtMobility Sensors 1.2. This document attempts to explain
    where things must be changed in order to port applications to Qt Sensors.

    \section1 QML

    Compatibility for QML applications is provided by shipping the legacy \c QtMobility.sensors
    QML import. QML applications should not require any changes to continue operating.

    Applications using the legacy QML import may not be able to trivially port over
    to the new QML import because the new QML import does not provide types for
    every sensor like the legacy QML import does.

            \li Information about the Qt Sensors QML API
        \row
            \li \l {QtMobility.sensors 1.x}{Legacy QML API}
            \li Information about the legacy QtMobility.sensors QML API
    \endtable

    \section1 C++

    \section2 Includes

    QtMobility Sensors installed headers into a \c Qt Sensors directory. This is
    also the directory that Qt Sensors uses. It is therefore expected that includes
    that worked with QtMobility Sensors should continue to work.

    For example:
    \code
    #include <QAccelerometer>
    #include <qaccelerometer.h>
    #include <QtSensors/QAccelerometer>
    #include <QtSensors/qaccelerometer.h>
    \endcode

    \section2 Macros and Namespace

    QtMobility Sensors was built in a \c QtMobility namespace. This was enabled by
    the use of various macros. Qt Sensors does not normally build into a namespace
    and the macros from QtMobility no longer exist.

    \list
    \li QTM_BEGIN_NAMESPACE
    \li QTM_END_NAMESPACE
    \li QTM_USE_NAMESPACE
    \li QTM_PREPEND_NAMESPACE(x)
    \endlist

    Note that Qt can be configured to build into a namespace. If Qt is built in this
    way then Qt Sensors is also built into the nominated namespace. However, as this
    is optional, the macros for this are typically defined to do nothing.

    \list
    \li QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE
    \li QT_END_NAMESPACE
    \li QT_USE_NAMESPACE
    \li QT_PREPEND_NAMESPACE(x)
    \endlist

    \section2 qtimestamp

    qtimestamp was previously defined as an opaque type equivalent to a quint64. It existed
    as a class due to an implementation detail.

    In Qt Sensors, the API uses quint64 instead of qtimestamp. qtimestamp still exists as a
    typedef so that applications that refer to qtimestamp can be compiled.

    \section1 Project Files

    QtMobility Sensors applications used this in their project files to enable the Sensors API.

    \code
    CONFIG += mobility
    MOBILITY += sensors
    \endcode

    Applications should remove these lines and instead use this to enable the Qt Sensors API.

    \code
    QT += sensors
    \endcode
